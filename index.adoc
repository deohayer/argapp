= argapp - A Python package for CLI application development

== Overview

argapp is an OOP wrapper for link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html[argparse] and link:https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete[argcomplete].

* Allows writing CLI applications using OOP - encapsulates argparse API.
* Optionally supports shell completion - encapsulates argcomplete API.

=== Features

* Offers several classes that allow building a Python CLI application in OOP style.
** `Arg` represents optional and positional arguments, with the most essential use cases covered.
** `App` represents a main appplication or a subcommand.
** The fields are validated, raising an appropriate `Exception` in case of any issues.
** The command line parsing of values can be customized via `+Arg.__call__+`.
** The actual application execution should be implemented in `+App.__call__+`.
* Offers shell completion support if argcomplete is installed:
** The required API calls are already in place. It is only required to install argcomplete and add the `PYTHON_ARGCOMPLETE_OK` comment.
